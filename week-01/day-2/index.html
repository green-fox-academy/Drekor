        <h2 class="pink">Fullstack software Developer</h2>

        <p>
            I love to design complex systems with high levels of automation including AI and robotics. I’m deeply interested in inventing
            new things that can augment the human experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything I’ve done, everything I’ll do today, everything I’ll ever do, I do to protect this world. Someone once told me
            that with great power comes great responsibility.

        <h2>Instruction set</h2>

        <h2>CPU</h2>

        <p>
            It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or
            more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
        </p>

        <h2>ASCII</h2>

        <p>
            It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical
            representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.
        </p>

        <h2>RAM</h2>

        <p>
            It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of
            a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective
            of the physical location of data inside the memory.
        </p>

        <h2>Programming Language</h2>

        <p>
            A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally
            consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
        </p>

        <h2>DNS</h2>

        <p>
            A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private

        </p>

        <h2>TCP</h2>

        <p>
            An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data
            communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.
